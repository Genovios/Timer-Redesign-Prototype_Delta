# Redesign Prototype

## Purpose

### User Story
**As a** user of a timer app
**I want** a better interface
**So that** I can set up my timer in fewer clicks

Use this timer to set your time faster!

## Test Case

**Success is gauged by the number of clicks needed to set the timer. Fewer is better!**

* Using the current timer design displayed on the webpage, it took 3 clicks to set and start a timer for one minute (60 seconds); one click for 6, another for 0, and
one more to start the timer.

* Using the prototype design, it took only one click to both set and start the timer for one minute, thanks to the presets and autostart.
